# CloudOps Orchestrator

> Enterprise-grade multi-cloud infrastructure automation platform built with Python. This project provides a robust foundation for managing and orchestrating cloud resources and infrastructure across multiple providers.

## ⚡ Key Features

*   **Multi-Cloud Management:** Unified API for interacting with AWS, Azure, GCP, and OpenStack.
*   **Infrastructure as Code:** Integration with Terraform for automated infrastructure provisioning.
*   **Kubernetes Operator:** A custom Kubernetes operator for application lifecycle management.
*   **Task-Based Execution:** Long-running operations are handled by Celery background workers.
*   **Monitoring & Observability:** Pre-configured stack with Prometheus and Grafana.
*   **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, and Docker.

## Architecture

The application consists of a central FastAPI server that provides the API, a set of Celery workers for asynchronous task execution, a PostgreSQL database for metadata storage, and a Redis instance for caching and message broking. The system is designed to be extensible, with a provider-based architecture for adding new cloud integrations.

## ️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Docker and Docker Compose
*   Python 3.11+
*   Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:Jose-M12/cloudops-Orchestrator.git
    cd cloudops-Orchestrator
    ```

2.  **Set up the environment:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following content:
    ```env
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@db:5432/cloudops
    REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
    SECRET_KEY=a-very-secret-key
    ```

3.  **Build and run the application:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This will start the FastAPI application, PostgreSQL database, Redis, and the Celery worker. The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

4.  **Run database migrations:**
    In a separate terminal, run the following command to apply the initial database migrations:
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec api alembic upgrade head
    ```

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

*   `app/`: The core FastAPI application.
*   `worker/`: The Celery worker and task definitions.
*   `operators/`: The Kubernetes operator.
*   `terraform/`: Terraform modules and environment configurations.
*   `monitoring/`: Prometheus and Grafana configurations.
*   `deployments/`: Kubernetes and Helm deployment manifests.
*   `tests/`: Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
